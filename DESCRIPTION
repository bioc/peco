Description: Our approach provides a way to assign continuous cell cycle phase 
    using scRNA-seq data, and consequently, allows to identify cyclic trend 
    of gene expression levels along the cell cycle. This package provides method
    and training data, which includes scRNA-seq data collected from 6 individual 
    cell lines of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also continuous cell 
    cycle phase derived from FUCCI fluorescence imaging data.
